# Password-Generator
This was my first attempt at writing Javascript. For this assignment, I was given starter code that included complete files for HTML and CSS. 
Deployed Application:

## Goals of the Password Generator
I needed to provide a series of prompts to determine:
-The password length. I provided a prompt window, but was asked to keep the password between 8-128 characters.
-Then I needed to establish what characters the person wanted. Options needed to include, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 
-Once all the information was collected from the prompts and confirms, then the generated password would appear in the box.

## What I Learned
This was definitely a challenge. I genuinely learned so much valuable information. 
The few highlights:
-"concat" was very important for this assignment. I needed to take the other arrays that I created with all the different characters and combine them into one finalPassword variable. 
-"parseInt" was a new one for me. This was used to change the input for the length of the password from a string type to a number type.
-The last thing was the importance of the "for loop". I'm not even sure I have my brain totally wrapped around it, but plan to continue to study it.
